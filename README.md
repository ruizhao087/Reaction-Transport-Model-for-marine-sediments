A detailed one-demensional reaction transport model accounting for the early diagenesis of marine sediments in deep-sea sediments, with focus on the transformation of TOC, DIC, O2, NO3-, NH4+, and dissolved Mn.

Supplied the model with calibration data, e.g., porewater profiles in Supplementary Dataset 2 of Zhao et al. (2020), the code should be able to generate similation profiles and a comparion summary of the modelled and measured data. In case of any problem, please contact the authors.
